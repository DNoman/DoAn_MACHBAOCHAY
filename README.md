# PROJECT_FIRE-ALARM-CIRCUIT
* Fire alarm circuit using 8051 microcontroller
* File Project.c running PROTEUS simulation circuit
* File Project_real.c contains code to run ACTUAL circuit (AT89S51 chip)
* Video file saves the actual project running process (LCD screen is difficult to see due to unstable light capture device)
* Project_Report.doc file for subject project report
